# Snowball-Fight

The first release has the source code in this repository and was the first version I made of this game. The second release is a newer version of the game I made that I lost the code for but luckily still have the jar for.

To run the Snowball Fight game just download the initial release zip. Make sure to keep the .jar file and data folder in the same location.
